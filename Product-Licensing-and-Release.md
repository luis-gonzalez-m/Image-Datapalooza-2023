To meet the goals and motivations of this event, and to comply with the requirements and the Data Management Plan (DMP) associated with the NSF grants supporting this event, all data, model, and code products generated or augmented at and for Image Datapalooza must adhere to [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).

This means the following policy holds for all digital products developed or created at the event:

1. All digital products (code, data, models, documentation, tutorials, etc) developed at the event are to be released such that it is accessible to the public, at the latest at the conclusion of the event, under an [Open Content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content) license or terms of use.

2. Code is to be released under an [OSI-approved open source license](https://opensource.org/licenses/), or to the public domain (for example, by applying a [CC-Zero](https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/) waiver).
    * Scripts can simply be added to this GitHub repository. For more complex codebases, we recommend using a version control repository on GitHub, Gitlab, etc.

3. Data, documents, tutorials, etc are to be released either to the public domain (for example, by applying a [CC-Zero](https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/) waiver), or under terms no more restrictive than requiring attribution (such as [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/)).
    * For ML-ready datasets, we recommend using [Hugging Face Dataset Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/datasets-overview), which provides for rich metadata description in the form of a [Dataset Card](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/datasets-cards).

4. ML models are to be released under an [OSI-approved open source license](https://opensource.org/licenses/), or a [Responsible AI License](https://www.licenses.ai/ai-licenses) (RAIL) (in particular [Open RAIL-M](https://www.licenses.ai/blog/2022/8/18/naming-convention-of-responsible-ai-licenses)), or to the public domain (for example, by applying a [CC-Zero](https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/) waiver).
    * For further guidance, consider the chapter on [Machine Learning Model Licenses](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-ml.html) from The Turing Way.
    * For storage, version control, sharing, and publishing (including DOI provision), we recommend using [Hugging Face Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/models), which provides for rich metadata description in the form or a [Model Card](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/model-cards). (See [Imageomics models](https://huggingface.co/imageomics) published there as examples.)
